        There are also planning attributes, which describe the way the business is run. Ex: You
        r staff members get daily temperature checks and customers must wear a mask due to your COVID-19 heal
        th and safety protocols. A short and precise ph
        rase like “mask required” and “daily temperature check” would be a planning attribute for your business. </p>
